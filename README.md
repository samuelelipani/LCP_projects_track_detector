# Final Projects for Laboratory of Computational Physics
This repository contains the final project of the course of LCP. Its main topic is the reconstruction of tracks of particles measured by fast track detectors. Data are analyzed as a stream and not in parallel. Each jupyter notebook is a part of the project: preprocessing, filtering and visual reconstruction of tracks.
